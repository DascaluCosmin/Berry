## General info

* The application allows the user to create an account, log in and then interact with other users by:
  - Checking the news feed so that the most recent friends' posts are not missed - berry or unberry them (like / unlike).
  - Searching a friend's profile.
  - Adding new Photo/Text Posts and a Profile Photo.
  - Participating to events - either hosting them or simply participating to others' events. 
  - Being notified when an event is drawing closer.
  - Chatting with friends, checking the inbox and sending messages to a group of friends.
  - Exploring other users, accepting or declining their friend requests.
  - Getting statistics about user activity - pie charts, PDF and HTML report formats.
