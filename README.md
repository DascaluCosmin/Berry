## General info

* The application allows the user to create an account, log in and then interact with other users by:
  - Checking the news feed so that the most recent friends' posts are not missed - berry or unberry them (like / unlike).
  - Searching a friend's profile.
  - Adding new Photo/Text Posts and a Profile Photo.
  - Participating to events - either hosting them or simply participating to others' events. 
  - Being notified when an event is drawing closer.
  - Chatting with friends, checking the inbox and sending messages to a group of friends.
  - Exploring other users, accepting or declining their friendship requests.
  - Getting statistics about user activity - pie charts, PDF and HTML report formats.
  
* The scope of this project was to strengthen my Java and Relational Data Bases knowledge. 
It started as a university project, but then I developed it further - additional functionalities and a more complex GUI.

## Technologies
* Java SE - used for the main development of the application. 
* JavaFX - used for the development of the GUI. 
* IntelliJ IDEA - the used IDE. 
* PostgreSQL - used for the management of the data base. 
* JasperReports - used for the generation of reports. 
* Adobe XD - tool used for the development of the GUI. 
* Gradle - Build Automation Tool.
